# Interactive Music Mixer Design
# Project 1: Drag n Drop!
* Creating a drag and drop application with Javascript elements, HTML, and CSS. Final product will be similar to Incredibox but not ripping it off directly.

## Description
We want to make a scenic shot of a walking trail in the country. Far away from the bustling cities, all you can hear are the sounds of animals and the general ambience of rural Ontario. Plug in your headphones and escape to the beautiful countryside without ever leaving your desk.

The choice is yours as to what time of day it is. Animal icons will appear based on the three times of day available (morning, late afternoon, and night). Simply drag an icon to their respective area on the page and the sounds will mix, creating an authentic experience.
