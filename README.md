# Interactive Music Mixer Design
# Project 1: Drag n Drop!

Creating a drag and drop application with Javascript elements, HTML, and CSS. Final product will be similar to Incredibox but not ripping it off directly.

We want to make a scenic shot of a walking trail in the country. Far away from the bustling cities, all you can hear are the sounds of animals and the general ambience of rural Ontario.
